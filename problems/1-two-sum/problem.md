# Problem 1: Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Input Format:**
The first line contains the `target` integer.
The second line contains space-separated integers for the `nums` array.

**Output Format:**
Print the two indices, separated by a space.

**Example:**
Input:
9
2 7 11 15

Output:
0 1
