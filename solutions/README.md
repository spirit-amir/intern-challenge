### File Naming for Nested Problems

Our problems are organized in a **nested structure** (e.g., `s1 -> lec1 -> p1`). To submit a solution, you must **"flatten"** this path into a filename using a **double underscore `__`** as a separator.

**Example:**
If the problem is located at:
`problems/s1/lec1/p1/`
Your solution filename must be:
`s1_lec1_p1.py`
